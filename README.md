# Lemmy Linker Extension

Find it annoying to copy paste `!memes@beehaw.org` to look at a Lemmy community? This extension is for you.

This extension looks for Lemmy style communities and replaces them to direct you to seeing that community on your lemmy instance.

This extension is forked from https://github.com/FackJox/lemmy-link/fork, which is forked from https://github.com/driccio98/kbin-link, which is forked from https://github.com/masrly/mastodon-link. I made a small edit to change the icon

## Build

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- You can then load the extension from the `dist` directory

## Setup
